How to run the project:

1) change the absolute path to the blackbox executable in .../src/main/resources/application.properties 

2) run the jar by:

cd streamProcessingService/target 

java -jar streamProcessingService-1.0.jar

3) call the rest web service:

in a browser:

http://localhost:8080/counters

http://localhost:8080/deferredresult

http://localhost:8080/counterAsynch

each click will show how the counter growths.

The 3 controllers give the same result but the performance is different in stability and resources consumption.

I will like to try akka messages framework to see the difference with spring (use reactor underhood )
